# **Assignment 2 - Personal Website**

## **Project Overview**
This project is personal portfolio website, intended to complete SFU IAT 355 Assignment 2. Landing page (index.html) contains information about my professional background, skills, education, and design experiences. On the other hand, Visualizations (visualizations.html) page contains examples of my visualizations, specifically a bar graph and creative graphics. Both pages were created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## **Purpose**
The purpose of the website is to showcase my character and skills as a prospective designer. As I will soon join the workforce, it is necessary to have documentation of what I have done so far to qualify for a job. By structuring such information in a readable website format, this website serves the purpose of letting the potential employers know about my knowledge in design, especially in terms of visualizations using SVG. 

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML:** HTML is the standard markup language used to create structure of the website content, including text, links, and images. 
- **CSS:** CSS is the style sheet language controlling the appearance of a website content listed in HTML. I defined aesthetic features, such as colours, font, spacing, and flexboxes in CSS file. 
- **JavaScript:** Javascript is a programming language used to make interactive components within a website. I added behaviours to the website, such as opening and closing behaviour of a hamburger menu, and scrolling up action when up-arrow button is clicked. In this assignment in particular, SVG elements were created in Javascript files.  
- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):** SVG is a vector image format that define graphics that is scalable without losing its quality on any screen resolution.  

## **Assignment 2 Website Structure**
Following files were created for the Assignment 2:

- **`Assets folder`:** This folder contains picture that will be displayed in HTML files.   

- **`index.html`:** This is the landing page, which the audience is expected to see first. This file lists information about my background, education, skills, and my design experiences. 
  
- **`visualizations.html`:** This page shows the visualizations, specificaly one bar graph displaying visual information of what kinds of drinks I had last week, other than water, as well as two SVG drawings of animals that look like myself. 
  
- **`style.css`:** This CSS file controls the appearance of all the elements defined in HTML file, ensuring that the layout is **responsive**. 

- **`main.js`:** This is a Javascript file, defining the behaviours of a website when hamburger menu is clicked and when up-arrow button is clicked. 

- **`vis.js`:** This is another Javasciprt file, which enables creation and interaction (i.e. font becomes bold when mouse hovers on each bar on a graph) of SVG graphics. Please note that a bar graph was created using a **for loop**; the same codes were repeatedly run four times but with different parameters.

- **`README.md`:** This markdown file contains information about the purpose, technologies used, structure, and the ways to navigate the Assignment 2 Website. 

## **How to Navigate the Assignment Website**
1. **Landing page  (`index.html`):**
   - Download the files, then open **index.html**. This will display a landing page explaining my background, education, skills, and my contact information. 

2. **Visualizations Page (`visualizations.html`):**
    - As you download the files, you can open **visualization.html** to view my visualizations right away. There are two types of visualizations that can be seen in this file: bar graph and creative graphs, both created with SVG.
